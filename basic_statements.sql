-- To Select columns from tables
-- * indicate selecting all the columns in table orders
SELECT * FROM orders;

-- selecting few columns from orders table
SELECT id, account_id, occurred_at
FROM orders;

-- SQL queries can be run successfully whether characters are written in upper- or lower-case
SELECT account_id
FROM orders
--is the same as:
select account_id
from orders

-- Limiting the selected value by using LIMIT 
-- Here we are only getting starting 10 values from table
SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;

-- Question
-- Try using LIMIT yourself below by writing a query that displays all the data in the occurred_at, account_id, and channel columns of the web_events table, and limits the output to only the first 15 rows.
SELECT occurred_at, account_id, channel FROM web_events LIMIT 15;

-- The ORDER BY statement allows us to sort our results using the data in any column.
-- The ORDER BY statement always comes in a query after the SELECT and FROM statements, but before the LIMIT statement. If you are using the LIMIT statement, it will always appear last.
SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd from orders ORDER BY total_amt_usd limit 20;

-- Question
-- 1. Write a query to return the 10 earliest orders in the orders table. Include the id, occurred_at, and total_amt_usd.
SELECT id, occurred_at, total_amt_usd from orders ORDER BY occurred_at LIMIT 10;

-- 2. Write a query to return the top 5 orders in terms of largest total_amt_usd. Include the id, account_id, and total_amt_usd.
SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd from orders ORDER BY total_amt_usd desc limit 5;

-- 3. Write a query to return the lowest 20 orders in terms of smallest total_amt_usd. Include the id, account_id, and total_amt_usd.
SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd FROM orders ORDER BY total_amt_usd LIMIT 20;

-- Order By using two columns
-- Questions
-- 1. Write a query that displays the order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for all the orders, sorted first by the account ID (in ascending order), and then by the total dollar amount (in descending order).
SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY account_id, total_amt_usd DESC;

-- 2. Now write a query that again displays order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for each order, but this time sorted first by total dollar amount (in descending order), and then by account ID (in ascending order).
SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC, account_id;

-- Using the WHERE statement, we can display subsets of tables based on conditions that must be met. You can also think of the WHERE command as filtering the data.

-- Common symbols used in WHERE statements include:
> (greater than)

< (less than)

>= (greater than or equal to)

<= (less than or equal to)

= (equal to)

!= (not equal to)

-- Write a query that:

-- 1. Pulls the first 5 rows and all columns from the orders table that have a dollar amount of gloss_amt_usd greater than or equal to 1000.
select * from orders where gloss_amt_usd >= 1000 limit 5;

-- 2. Pulls the first 10 rows and all columns from the orders table that have a total_amt_usd less than 500
select * from orders where gloss_amt_usd < 500 limit 10;

-- The WHERE statement can also be used with non-numeric data. We can use the = and != operators here. You need to be sure to use single quotes (just be careful if you have quotes in the original text) with the text data, not double quotes.

-- query
-- Filter the accounts table to include the company name, website, and the primary point of contact (primary_poc) just for the Exxon Mobil company in the accounts table.
select name, website, primary_poc from accounts where name = 'Exxon Mobil';

-- Arithmetic Operators
-- Derived Columns
-- Creating a new column that is a combination of existing columns is known as a derived column (or "calculated" or "computed" column). Usually you want to give a name, or "alias," to your new column using the AS keyword.
-- If you are deriving the new column from existing columns using a mathematical expression, then these familiar mathematical operators will be useful:
* (Multiplication)
+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
/ (Division)

-- Consider this example:
SELECT id, (standard_amt_usd/total_amt_usd)*100 AS std_percent, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;

-- Questions using Arithmetic Operations
-- 1. Create a column that divides the standard_amt_usd by the standard_qty to find the unit price for standard paper for each order. Limit the results to the first 10 orders, and include the id and account_id fields.
select id, account_id, standard_amt_usd/standard_qty as standard_unit_price from orders limit 10;

-- 2. Write a query that finds the percentage of revenue that comes from poster paper for each order. You will need to use only the columns that end with _usd. (Try to do this without using the total column.) Display the id and account_id fields also
SELECT id, account_id, 
       poster_amt_usd/(standard_amt_usd + gloss_amt_usd + poster_amt_usd) AS post_per
FROM orders
LIMIT 100;

-- Introduction to Logical Operators
-- In the next concepts, you will be learning about Logical Operators. Logical Operators include:

LIKE This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for cases when you might not know exactly what you are looking for.

IN This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for more than one condition.

NOT This is used with IN and LIKE to select all of the rows NOT LIKE or NOT IN a certain condition.

AND & BETWEEN These allow you to combine operations where all combined conditions must be true.

OR This allows you to combine operations where at least one of the combined conditions must be true.

-- LIKE Opertor
The LIKE operator is extremely useful for working with text. You will use LIKE within a WHERE clause. The LIKE operator is frequently used with %. The % tells us that we might want any number of characters leading up to a particular set of characters or following a certain set of characters, as we saw with the google syntax above. 

-- Questions
-- 1. All the companies whose names start with 'C'.
select * 
from accounts 
where name like 'C%';

-- 2. All companies whose names contain the string 'one' somewhere in the name.
select * 
from accounts 
where name like '%one%';

-- 3. All companies whose names end with 's'.
select * 
from accounts 
where name like '%s';

-- IN Operator
-- The IN operator is useful for working with both numeric and text columns. This operator allows you to use an =, but for more than one item of that particular column. We can check one, two or many column values for which we want to pull data, but all within the same query.

-- Questions using IN operator
-- 1. Use the accounts table to find the account name, primary_poc, and sales_rep_id for Walmart, Target, and Nordstrom.
SELECT name, primary_poc, sales_rep_id
FROM accounts
WHERE name IN ('Walmart', 'Target','Nordstrom');

-- 2. Use the web_events table to find all information regarding individuals who were contacted via the channel of organic or adwords.
SELECT *
FROM web_events
WHERE channel in ('organic', 'adwords');

-- NOT operator
-- The NOT operator is an extremely useful operator for working with the previous two operators we introduced: IN and LIKE. By specifying NOT LIKE or NOT IN, we can grab all of the rows that do not meet a particular criteria.

-- Questions using the NOT operator
-- 1. Use the accounts table to find the account name, primary poc, and sales rep id for all stores except Walmart, Target, and Nordstrom.
SELECT name, primary_poc, sales_rep_id
FROM accounts
WHERE name NOT IN ('Walmart', 'Target', 'Nordstrom');

-- 2. Use the web_events table to find all information regarding individuals who were contacted via any method except using organic or adwords methods.
SELECT * 
FROM web_events
WHERE channel NOT IN ('organic', 'adwords');

-- 3. All the companies whose names do not start with 'C'.
SELECT * 
FROM accounts
WHERE name NOT LIKE 'C%';

-- 4. All companies whose names do not contain the string 'one' somewhere in the name.
SELECT * 
FROM accounts
WHERE name NOT LIKE '%one%';

-- 5. All companies whose names do not end with 's'.
SELECT * 
FROM accounts 
WHERE name NOT LIKE '%s';

-- AND Operator
-- The AND operator is used within a WHERE statement to consider more than one logical clause at a time. Each time you link a new statement with an AND, you will need to specify the column you are interested in looking at. You may link as many statements as you would like to consider at the same time. This operator works with all of the operations we have seen so far including arithmetic operators (+, *, -, /).* LIKE*,* IN*, and* NOT logic can also be linked together using the AND* operator.

WHERE column >= 6 AND column <= 10

-- BETWEEN Operator
-- Sometimes we can make a cleaner statement using BETWEEN than we can using AND. Particularly this is true when we are using the same column for different parts of our AND statement. In the previous video, we probably should have used BETWEEN.

WHERE column BETWEEN 6 AND 10

-- Questions using AND and BETWEEN operators
-- 1. Write a query that returns all the orders where the standard_qty is over 1000, the poster_qty is 0, and the gloss_qty is 0.

SELECT * 
FROM orders
WHERE standard_qty > 1000 AND poster_qty = 0 and gloss_qty = 0;

-- 2. Using the accounts table, find all the companies whose names do not start with 'C' and end with 's'.
SELECT name 
FROM accounts
WHERE name NOT LIKE 'c%' AND name LIKE '%s';

-- 3. When you use the BETWEEN operator in SQL, do the results include the values of your endpoints, or not? Figure out the answer to this important question by writing a query that displays the order date and gloss_qty data for all orders where gloss_qty is between 24 and 29. Then look at your output to see if the BETWEEN operator included the begin and end values or not.

SELECT occurred_at , gloss_qty
FROM orders 
WHERE gloss_qty BETWEEN 24 AND 29;

-- 4. Use the web_events table to find all information regarding individuals who were contacted via the organic or adwords channels, and started their account at any point in 2016, sorted from newest to oldest.
SELECT * 
FROM web_events 
where channel IN ('organic', 'adwords') AND occurred_at BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2017-01-01' 
ORDER BY occurred_at DESC;

-- OR Operator
-- Similar to the AND operator, the OR operator can combine multiple statements. Each time you link a new statement with an OR, you will need to specify the column you are interested in looking at.

-- Questions using the OR operator
--1.  Find list of orders ids where either gloss_qty or poster_qty is greater than 4000. Only include the id field in the resulting table.

SELECT id
FROM orders
WHERE gloss_qty > 4000 OR poster_qty > 4000 ;

-- 2. Write a query that returns a list of orders where the standard_qty is zero and either the gloss_qty or poster_qty is over 1000.
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE standard_qty = 0 AND (gloss_qty > 1000 OR poster_qty > 1000);

-- 3. Find all the company names that start with a 'C' or 'W', and the primary contact contains 'ana' or 'Ana', but it doesn't contain 'eana'.

SELECT *
FROM accounts 
WHERE (name LIKE 'C%' OR name LIKE 'W%') AND ((primary_poc LIKE '%ana%' OR primary_poc LIKE '%Ana%')
AND primary_poc NOT LIKE '%ena%');

-- RECAPof all the commands od SQL learned till now
-- Commands
-- You have already learned a lot about writing code in SQL! Let's take a moment to recap all that we have covered before moving on:

Statement	    How to Use It	            Other Details

SELECT	        SELECT Col1, Col2, ...	    Provide the columns you want
FROM	        FROM Table	                Provide the table where the columns exist
LIMIT	        LIMIT 10	                Limits based number of rows returned
ORDER BY        ORDER BY Col	            Orders table based on the column. Used with DESC.
WHERE	        WHERE Col > 5	            A conditional statement to filter your results
LIKE	        WHERE Col LIKE '%me%'	    Only pulls rows where column has 'me' within the text
IN	            WHERE Col IN ('Y', 'N')	    A filter for only rows with column of 'Y' or 'N'
NOT	            WHERE Col NOT IN ('Y', 'N')	NOT is frequently used with LIKE and IN
AND	            WHERE Col1 > 5 AND Col2 < 3	Filter rows where two or more conditions must be true
OR	            WHERE Col1 > 5 OR Col2 < 3	Filter rows where at least one condition must be true
BETWEEN	        WHERE Col BETWEEN 3 AND 5	Often easier syntax than using an AND

-- Other Tips
-- Though SQL is not case sensitive (it doesn't care if you write your statements as all uppercase or lowercase), we discussed some best practices. The order of the key words does matter! Using what you know so far, you will want to write your statements as:

SELECT col1, col2
FROM table1
WHERE col3  > 5 AND col4 LIKE '%os%'
ORDER BY col5
LIMIT 10;

-- LENGTH Function
-- LENGTH() function is used to determine the number of characters in a string. The LENGTH() function works with various types of strings, such as text, VARCHAR, and CHAR. Note that some databases also provide an equivalent function called LEN().
SELECT LENGTH(column_name) FROM table_name;
-- OR
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS City_Length
FROM STATION;
